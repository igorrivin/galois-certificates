\section{Warm-start factorization}
\label{sec:warmstart}

When the subset-sum intersection does not collapse, the surviving degrees give a small candidate set $D$ for rational factor degrees.
Restricting factor searches to $d\in D$ provides a warm start for Hensel lifting and recombination methods \cite{Zippel1979,vzGathenGerhard}.

This reduces the degree ambiguity from $\{1,\dots,n-1\}$ to a much smaller set and can substantially accelerate practical factorization.
