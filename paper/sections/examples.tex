\section{Examples and adversarial constructions}

We construct imprimitive families via resultants $F(x)=\operatorname{Res}_u(P(u),Q(u,x))$.
We also construct adversarial ``evil twins'' by perturbing coefficients by multiples of $M=\prod_{p<B} p$, preserving all reductions mod $p<B$ while typically restoring generic global Galois behavior.
