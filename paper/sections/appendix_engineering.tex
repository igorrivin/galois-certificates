\section{Engineering considerations}

Both the standard Monte-Carlo test and the subset-sum method parallelize across primes.
The subset-sum method is information-accumulating: every modular factorization contributes to the certificate.
PPR also permits smaller primes, reducing $\log p$ factors in bit complexity.
