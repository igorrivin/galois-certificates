\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Factoring, irreducibility, and Galois groups}
The problems of factoring polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$, testing irreducibility,
and determining Galois groups are central in computational algebra and number theory.
Deterministic algorithms are polynomial-time in theory but can be impractical at modest
degrees; modular methods scale extremely well.

\subsection{The Pemantle--Peres--Rivin subset-sum criterion}
Given the factor degrees $(d_i)$ of $f\bmod p$, form the subset-sum set $S_p$ of all sums
$\sum_{i\in I} d_i$. If $f$ has a rational factor of degree $d$, then $d\in S_p$ for all
good primes. If the intersection over sampled primes contains no proper degrees, then $f$
is irreducible.

\subsection{Failure modes and arithmetic imprimitivity}
Persistent subset-sum intersections often correlate with arithmetic imprimitivity, which
we exploit as a fast structure flag.

\subsection{Contributions and outline}
We develop a hybrid Monte-Carlo irreducibility test, a Monte-Carlo imprimitivity detector
producing explicit certificates, and a warm-start for factorization.
